In this challenge, you are going to implement Amazon’s pathfinding algorithm for Amazon’s self-driving delivery vehicles. The self-driving vehicle will need to create a path on a 2D-grid that contains a starting point (x,y), a delivery point (x,y) and a number of obstacles. Your vehicle can navigate to any of the adjacent squares (even diagonally), as long as the squares are inbound and do not contain an obstacle.

Self Evaluation

I understood the assignment well. I knew that we had to find and create an algorithm that finds a path to the end. I had no problems trying to figure out what I had to do. I was able to code everything up correctly. 

However there are improvements that I can make. The limitation to my work is the ability to code what im thinking directly into a programming language. I found programming this algorithm tricky and tiring. Doing the research for this challenge was managable. I used videos and articles to familiarise myself with different path finding algorithms, mainly the breadth first search algorithm.

The steps I would take to make these improvements are to further research and understand path finding algorithms in more depth. Plan for longer is another improvement. I didn't use enough time to plan my answer. I jumped straight into programming instead of taking a hour or so planning how to tackle this challenge. Another step I would take in the future is to ask for help from experienced individuals. I tackled this challenge by myself and some help would've directed me in the correct direction to solving this challenge.

Peer Review - Stellah Mubayiwa

I have understood the task at hand and the code review by the Amazon employee looks similar to what I have coded in this repository. All the obstacles match the obstacles in the challenge. 

The structure of my code is confusing and there are classes that I haven't used or used very little of so maybe I could get rid of them.
