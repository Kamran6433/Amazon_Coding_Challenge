In this challenge, you are going to implement Amazon’s pathfinding algorithm for Amazon’s self-driving delivery vehicles. The self-driving vehicle will need to create a path on a 2D-grid that contains a starting point (x,y), a delivery point (x,y) and a number of obstacles. Your vehicle can navigate to any of the adjacent squares (even diagonally), as long as the squares are inbound and do not contain an obstacle.

Self Evaluation

I understood the assignment well. I knew that we had to find and create an algorithm that finds a path to the end. I had no problems trying to figure out what I had to do. I was able to code everything up correctly. 

However there are improvements that I can make. The limitation to my work is the ability to code what im thinking directly into a programming language. I found programming this algorithm tricky and tiring. Doing the research for this challenge was managable. I used videos and articles to familiarise myself with different path finding algorithms, mainly the breadth first search algorithm.
